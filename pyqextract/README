pyqextract

pyqextract.py will decode Symantec quarantined vbn files.  
This decoder removes the magic bytes Symantec adds to each file 
that is quarantined.  The "magic bytes" break the IAT, data/code 
segments by offsetting everything in the executable.

Usage: python pyqextract.py 578D3452A.VBN outifle.exe
