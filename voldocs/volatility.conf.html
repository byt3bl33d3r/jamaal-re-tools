    <pre>Configuration modules for pyflag.

PyFlag is a complex package and requires a flexible configuration
system. The following are the requirements of the configuration
system:

1) Configuration must be available from a number of sources:

   - Autoconf must be able to set things like the python path (in case
     pyflag is installed to a different prefix)
     
   - Users must be able to configure the installed system for their
   specific requirements.

   - Unconfigured parameters must be resolved at run time through the
   GUI and saved.

2) Configuration must be able to apply to cases specifically.

3) Because pyflag is modular, configuration variables might be required
   for each module. This means that definitions and declarations of
   configuration variables must be distributed in each plugin.

These goals are achieved by the use of multiple sources of
configuration information:

   - The system wide configuration file is this file: conf.py. It is
   generated from the build system from conf.py.in by substituting
   autoconfigured variables into it. It contains the most basic
   settings related to the installation, e.g. which python interpreted
   is used, where the python modules are installed etc. In particular
   it refers to the location of the system configuration file (usually
   found in /usr/local/etc/pyflagrc, or in /etc/pyflagrc).

   - The sysconfig file contains things like where the upload
   directory is, where to store temporary files etc. These are mainly
   installation wide settings which are expected to be modified by the
   administrator. Note that if you want the GUI to manipulate this
   file it needs to be writable by the user running the GUI.

   - Finally a conf table in each case is used to provide a per case
   configuration
